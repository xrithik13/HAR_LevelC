📌 Human Activity Recognition (HAR) – Synthetic Accelerometer ML Project



This project simulates accelerometer data for walking, running, and sitting, extracts features from the signals, and trains a Random Forest classifier to recognize the activity.



It demonstrates the complete ML pipeline used in IoT and wearable devices (like smartwatches).
