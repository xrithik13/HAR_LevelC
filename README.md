Human Activity Recognition (HAR) – Synthetic Accelerometer Project

This project simulates how a wearable device (like a smartwatch) detects human activities using accelerometer signals.
Instead of using a large external dataset, the script generates synthetic but realistic time-series sensor data for three activities:

Walking

Running

Sitting

The goal is to understand the full ML workflow behind activity recognition systems — from raw signals → feature extraction → model training → evaluation.

🌟 What This Project Does

Generates 3-axis accelerometer data with realistic patterns

Splits data into fixed-size windows

Extracts meaningful statistical features from each window

Trains a Random Forest classifier

Evaluates performance using a confusion matrix

Saves the trained model (har_levelc_model.joblib)

Even though the dataset is synthetic, the overall process closely matches real HAR systems.

📈 Results

The model typically achieves 95–100% accuracy, since the activities have distinct patterns.

A confusion matrix is saved here:

It shows how well the model distinguishes between walking, running, and sitting.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

This project helped me understand:

How accelerometer data looks for different activities

How to extract useful features from time-series data

How to train and evaluate ML classifiers

How to visualize correctness using a confusion matrix

How to save ML models

How to structure a clean, reproducible ML project

This builds foundational knowledge for real HAR systems and IoT/embedded ML work.

▶️ How to Run the Project
Install required packages:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib

Run:
python har_levelc.py


The model and confusion matrix image will be generated automatically.

💡 Why This Project Matters

Human Activity Recognition is widely used in:

Fitness trackers

Health monitoring

Gesture recognition

Wearable devices

Smart home systems

IoT and embedded ML applications

This project gives a beginner-friendly, end-to-end understanding of how such systems work internally — making it a strong addition to a portfolio or internship application.
